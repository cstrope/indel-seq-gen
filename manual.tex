\section{Overview}

indel-Seq-Gen is a tool to simulate the evolutionary events of highly diverged DNA and protein 
sequences.  Long-term evolution often include dynamic changes such as
insertions and deletions (indels), but some subsequences, such as domains and
motifs, retain their original sequences and structures better than less functionally important
regions.  indel-Seq-Gen allows for the simulation of many different evolutionary patterns over
different regions of a sequence, in the end outputting the ``true'' multiple alignment
of the sequences.  indel-Seq-Gen also has the unique feature of being able to input a multiple
alignment for the root sequence, which can be used to create different but related ancestral
sequences in each run.  These features can be used in many evolutionary studies, such as to
test the accuracy of multiple alignment methods, phylogenetic methods, evolutionary
hypotheses, ancestral sequence reconstruction methods, and superfamily classification methods.


\section{Getting Started}

indel-Seq-Gen is freely downloadable at {\tt http://bioinfolab.unl.edu/$\sim$cstrope/iSG/}.  
indel-Seq-Gen has been tested on RedHat Linux, SuSE Linux, IRIX, CentOS, and MacOS X (versions 10.2.8, 
10.3.9, 10.4.7, and Leopard).  You will need {\tt g++} compiler if the provided executables do 
not run on your system.

After downloading {\tt indel-Seq-Gen} files, there are a couple of steps that need to be
performed to reflect the difference between your system and the system {\tt indel-Seq-Gen} was
created on:

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\it If you download the {\tt iSG\_source.tar.gz} source archive:}  Open the archive by 
typing the two commands:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item[] {\tt gunzip iSG\_source.tar.gz}, and then
 \item[] {\tt tar -xvf iSG\_source.tar}
 \end{itemize}
This creates a directory {\tt iSG} with all of the files.  Go to this directory. Create
indel-Seq-Gen by typing ``{\tt make}''. 
\end{enumerate}

For other {\tt .tar.gz} archives, such as the precompiled (executable) programs for Linux and
Mac OS X, you can open the archive using the above two commands by
replacing the {\tt iSG\_source.tar.gz} with the appropriate archive name.  If you are using
the Linux precompiled program, you can see if the program works on your system by typing
``{\tt indel-Seq-Gen -h}'' and see if it outputs the option lists.  If you receive any error
message or if you cannot find {\tt indel-Seq-Gen} file, you will need to download the {\tt
iSG\_source.tar.gz} file and compile the program for your system using the commands above.

If you are using a Mac OSX precompiled program, first change the name of {\tt
indel-Seq-Gen-OSX10.4.7} or {\tt indel-Seq-Gen-OSX10.2.8} to {\tt indel-Seq-Gen} by typing:  
\verb+mv indel-Seq-Gen-OSX10.*.* indel-Seq-Gen+ for the correct version, then you can test to see if 
your program works as above.

After performing these steps, {\tt indel-Seq-Gen} is ready to run!

\section{Global Options}

To run indel-Seq-Gen from the command prompt, type the following line:

\begin{verbatim}
./indel-Seq-Gen -m <matrix> [-options] < tree_file > outfile
\end{verbatim} 

\noindent The ``tree\_file'' above is the ``spec'' file, which is described in
Section~\ref{sec:options}. ``{\tt $>$ outfile}'' is to save all the messages {\tt
indel-Seq-Gen} generates in the file. If ``{\tt $>$ outfile}'' is not added to the command,
everything will be simply displayed on the screen (but not saved in any file).\\~\\

{\tt indel-Seq-Gen} has many options. We suggest that you first run the example shown in
Section~\ref{sec:example}.  All necessary files are included in the provided {\tt iSG}
directory.  If you get any error message and the program does not run, please make sure if you
followed the steps explained in the previous section. If you still cannot run the program,
please contact us. The contact information is found in the first page.

\section{Subsequence Options}
\label{sec:options}

Specifications for each subsequence are given in the ``spec'' file.  
Figure~\ref{fig:complex_tree} shows the format of the file. Specifications for each
subsequence are separated by `;'. An example ``spec'' file is the file ``{\tt tree\_file}''
included in the iSG directory.

Subsequence options allow the user to create domain-specific effects on a subsequence by 
overriding the global parameters that are set as in Table~\ref{tab:global}.  These options are 
shown in Table~\ref{tab:options}.

the alignment, and `3' is the method of creating the consensus root sequence. For further 
details, see Section~\ref{sec:root}. The last two formats, a numeric value (not preceded by `:'), 
is to generate a random sequence of the given length and use as the root sequence. When using 
the options with `\#', relative rates will be assigned to each partition. Using the `\#' option

\section{Root Sequence Input}
\label{sec:root}

The root sequence is specified by the square brackets ({\tt [ ]}) in the spec file.  

There are three options for root sequence input:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Specifying a length of root sequence. indel-Seq-Gen will randomly generate a root 
sequence of the specified length.  For example {\tt [40]} calls for a root sequence of length 
40 characterss.
\item Root sequence input.
\item Multiple alignment input.
\end{enumerate}

Make sure that the input file is in the same directory when using an input file (options 2 
and 3).

\subsection{Root Sequence Input}

This option specifies that the user has a root sequence in a file for a partition.  

Spec file:
\begin{verbatim}
[:<rootseq_file>]
\end{verbatim}

Format:
\begin{verbatim}
<length of sequence>
<invariable array>
<sequence>
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{fig:trx} gives an example of a root sequence for conserving a Thioredoxin-fold 
protein sequence motif.

\begin{figure}[btph]
 \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|}
  \hline
  \texttt{20} \\
  \texttt{00003223100000000000 } \\
  \texttt{LARDCVLCSTWVTIALACLK } \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
\caption{Thioredoxin-fold proteins have a characteristic ``CXXC'' motif that is conserved for 
all proteins in the family.  This root sequence input requires the CXXC motif to remain 
constant for all sequences created through the use of the invariable array (described later), 
listed above the root sequence. The serine in position 9 will also be held invariable, though 
insertions are allowed to occur between itself and the previous cysteine.  Finally, the length 
of the root sequence is given by the first line. Note that this sequence is not truly a 
Trx-fold sequence, but an example to show the usage of the invariable array.}
\label{fig:trx}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Multiple Alignment Input}

This option specifies that the user has a multiple alignment of their sequence set, and 
wants a root sequence created from the multiple alignment. 

Spec file:
\begin{verbatim}
[:<ma_file>(1,2,3)]
\end{verbatim}

Options 1, 2, and 3 stand for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The range of the multiple alignment to use, where the format is {\it beginning}{\tt 
:}{\it end}.  An input of {\tt 21:67} specifies the range from the 21st to the 67th spot 
(inclusive) of the input multiple alignment.  Default for this option is the entire range of 
the multiple alignment. 
\item The number of sequences to choose from the multiple alignment.  indel-Seq-Gen randomly 
with replacement selects the specified number of sequences from the multiple alignment.  
Default for this option is to use all sequences.
\item Method for collapsing the multiple alignment into a root sequence, either random 
{\tt `r'} or consensus {\tt `c'}.  Consensus is a majority-rule method, using a coin flip to 
break ties.  Random uses a weighted coin toss based on the character composition at the site 
to choose the representative character, except for invariable positions, which will be chosen by consensus.  
For an example of the weighted coin toss, look at the first column in 
Figure~\ref{fig:input_MA} in which all sequences emit an amino acid, column 6.  In this 
column, there are 2 T's, 1 V, and 1 C.  A weighted coin toss on this column will be a T 50\% 
of the time, a V 25\% of the time, and a C 25\% of the time. The default for this option is 
consensus.
\end{enumerate}

When specifying the multiple alignment in the spec file, a blank field specifies that the default
entry for the field is desired.  For example, \verb+[:input_MA(,,r)]+ indicates that the entire range and
all sequences from {\tt input\_MA} will be used, but that the character that will
represent the column will be chosen by a weighted coin toss based on the characters that
appear in that column.  Note that the size of the root sequence can fluctuate 
between simulation runs.  For example, using the option \verb+[:input_MA(,1,)]+ will 
randomly choose a single sequence to create root sequence, thus the sequence that 
indel-Seq-Gen chooses will be the length of the root sequence for that subsequence.\\

Format:
\begin{verbatim}
<invariable array>
<sequence 1>
<sequence 2>
 .      .
 .      . 
 .      .
<sequence n>
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{fig:input_MA} is an example of an input multiple alignment of the SET-C region of 
the SET-domain family. Note that the `-' is the only character that will be accepted for the
gap character. Irregular characters (``YRUN'' in nucleotides, ``BZJX'' in amino acids) cause each
character for which they stand for to be counted as the 1 over the number of characters they
represent (e.g., `B' increments both `N' and `D' by 0.5).

SET-domain family of sequences.  The GXXL motif is conserved, as well as the tyrosine and 
isoleucine.}
\label{fig:input_MA}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Invariable Array}

The invariable array in indel-Seq-Gen is a quaternary array that specifies how a region is 
allowed to evolve, and is specified in the root sequence input.  Table~\ref{tab:invariable} 
shows the effect of each numerical entry in the invariable array, and 
Figure~\ref{fig:placement} shows an example of how the algorithm finds possible positions for 
indels based on the invariable array.

\begin{table}[Htbp]
\caption{Representation of positions in the invariable array, and effects on the sequence.
Invariable sites (1 and 3) block both deletion and substitution of the corresponding position 
in the sequence array.  No-indel sites (2 and 3) block deletion of the sequence array, but 
also block insertion events from occurring between consecutive no-indel positions (between 
2-2, 2-3, 3-2, and 3-3) in the invariable array.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline

\hline
0 & None \\
1 & Invariable \\
2 & No-indel \\
3 & Invariable + No-indel  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:invariable}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[Htbp]
\begin{verbatim}
Accepting Positions:

  Invariable Array:       0 0 1 2 3 0
  Insertion (any size):  1 1 1 1 0 1 1

  Invariable Array:       0 0 1 2 3 0
  Deletion (size 1):      1 1 0 0 0 1
  Deletion (size 2):      1 0 0 0 0 0
  Deletion (size 3):      0 0 0 0 0 0

\end{verbatim}
\caption{The invariable array and accepting positions for insertion and deletion 
events. For insertions, the accepting positions (denoted by `1' and `0' above) are located in 
between consecutive positions in the invariable array, while deletion accepting positions 
correspond exactly those in the invariable array.  In the accepting positions, the site with 
`1' is allowed to have indels. In the rare case that an accepting position cannot be found (as 
in the size 3 deletion example above), indel-Seq-Gen will output an error, but continue the
simulation run.}
\label{fig:placement}
\end{figure}

\section{Other Input Files}

\subsection{Character Frequencies {\tt \#f{\it freq\_file}\#}}

Protein and nucleotide subsequences often evolve under different functional constraints, causing 
them to display different character frequencies. For this, a file containing 20 amino acid
frequencies (order: ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYV) or 4 nucleotide frequencies (order: ACGT) separated by 
commas can be entered for each subsequence with the option: 
\verb+#f<freq_file>#+.  Values from the input file are read and normalized to create a 
distribution, where the number of values is specified by the maximum indel size of the 
subsequence. For an example, see the file {\tt aaf.freq} included with all iSG {\tt .tar.gz} 
archive downloads.

\subsection{Indel Probabilities {\tt \{\#$_1$,\#$_2$,{\it indel\_file(s)}\}}}

Insertion and deletion frequencies can be provided for each subsequence.  The format of the
file is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:zipf}.  This example is for the indel probabilities of sizes
1--10 of the Zipfian distribution described in Chang and Benner~\cite{Chang04}.  
indel-Seq-Gen will read in the number of values corresponding to the {\tt max\_indel\_size}
(\#$_1$) specified for the subsequence (for Figure~\ref{fig:zipf}, the maximum indel size of a
subsequence using this file can be up to size 10), and then normalize the values to create a
distribution.  This means that the frequencies can be given in absolute numbers or in any
scale (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:zipf}).  If the maximum indel size is greater than the
number of indel positions in the length distribution file, indel-Seq-Gen will output a message
that it is unable to read the input distribution file.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\fbox{\texttt{2628,743.8,355.5,210.5,140.2,100.6,76,59.6,48.1,39.7}}
\caption{An example length distribution input file.  This has the frequencies of indels with 
lengths from 1 to 10 amino acids, taken from the first 10 values of the Zipfian 
distribution.  The number of values in this file should not be smaller than the given max 
indel size.}
\label{fig:zipf}
\end{figure}

\section{Examples}
\label{sec:example}

\subsection{Toy Example}

Figure~\ref{fig:complex_tree} gives an example of a spec file that uses all options available.   
This spec file is given as the file {\tt tree\_file} in the iSG directory.
Figure~\ref{fig:NEX} shows the NEXUS output file for the first two partitions.
To run this example from the command line, type:

\begin{verbatim}
./indel-Seq-Gen -m JTT -l 200 -n 1 -o n -b 60 -e outfiles -q < tree_file
\end{verbatim}

This command runs in the quiet mode ({\tt -q}) one simulation ({\tt -n 1}), with the JTT
matrix ({\tt -m JTT}), outputting the root sequence into {\tt outfiles.root}, the sequences
into {\tt outfiles.seq}, and the multiple alignment into {\tt outfiles.ma} ({\tt -e
outfiles}). The multiple alignment output will be in NEXUS format ({\tt -o n}) printing 60
residues per line in the multiple alignment file ({\tt -b 60}).  Note that the length option
({\tt -l})  is required, even though a multiple alignment file ({\tt input\_MA}) is specified
in the spec file.  The spec file is given in the file {\tt tree\_file}, which is shown on the
top of Figure~\ref{fig:complex_tree}, with the following options for each subsequence:

\begin{itemize}

\item[] Subsequence 1: Labelled ``Thioredoxin-like Sequence'' in the multiple alignment
output.  Each branch length is scaled by the factor of 0.1, and the root sequence is found in
the file {\tt [:CXXC\_like]} (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:trx}).  The maximum indel size is 5,
and indels are created using Chang and Benner's indel distribution formulation.

\item[] Subsequence 2: Labelled ``Long Subseq'' in the multiple alignment output.  22\% of the
positions in this subsequence will be held invariable, the substitution matrix is PAM, and the
amino acid frequency is in the file {\tt aaf.freq}.  The root sequence is a randomly generated
sequence of 40 residues.  The maximum indel size is 7, and the insertion and deletion
frequency are equal, with 1.2 indels occurring every 100 substitutions.  The length
distribution of the insertion and deletions are found in the file {\tt idLD}.

\item[] Subsequence 3: Labelled ``seq 3'' in the multiple alignment output.  No subsequence
options are changed for the evolution of this subsequence.  The root sequence is built from
the file {\tt input\_MA}, using every position, and taking the consensus sequence of each
column.  The indel model is more complex, still allowing the maximum indel size of 7, but
insertions happen 0.3 times per 100 substitutions following the ``inLD'' length distribution,
while deletions occur 1.1 times per 100 substitutions following the ``delLD'' length
distribution.  Most interestingly, however, is that ``seq 3'' also follows a different
evolutionary pattern than either of the first two subsequences, where Taxon3 and Taxon4 are
switched (note that this is a rooted tree).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coding Region Simulation}
\label{sec:coding_region}
Figure~\ref{fig:coding_region} is an example of a coding region simulation run. To run this
example from the command line, type:

\begin{verbatim}
./indel-Seq-Gen -m F84 --num_runs 2 --length 200 -w -c 0.15,0.05,0.8 < nuc.tree
\end{verbatim}

This command is similar to the previous example, with the exception of using the F84 nucleotide matrix,
and specifying codon relative rates for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd codons ({\tt -c 0.15,0.05,0.8}). The spec
file, {\tt nuc.tree}, holds two exons separated by a single intron. Note the intron is not
affected by the codon relative rates ({\tt \#r\#}), and that the indel distribution file contains
non-zero entries for only those indel lengths that are multiples of three. Figure~\ref{fig:coding_region} are
displays all files needed to run this example.

\subsection{GPCR Olfactory-receptor Files}

The spec file used in the GPCR Olfactory-receptor example in the indel-Seq-Gen manuscript are
included in the downloadable archives under the name ``{\tt gpcr\_olfac.tree}''.  All of the
input files necessary for {\tt gpcr\_olfac.tree} are also included in the download.

\section{Version History}
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.5] indel-Seq-Gen PERL translated to C++, integrated seq-gen fully for a significant speedup. 
New features include gamma distributions, codon rates, long input options, output of .verb file,
\#r\# switch, 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt scale} took into account all items requiring scaling, i.e., branchScale, treeScale, and
    \emph{invariable_proportion normalization}. Such normalization then affected the branch lengths
    used to determine indels. 
  \item Added new indel tests corresponding to the function $E(I)=BL\times(P_{ins}N_i+P_{del}N_d)$,
    New version accounts for variables $N_i$ and $N_d$. Account for new positions added and deleted
    during simulation run to allow all permutations of insertions along a subtree path to produce 
    the same sequence (provided the same random number seed) results.
  \end{itemize}
\item[1.0] Initial release. indel-Seq-Gen is a PERL wrapper for the modified seq-gen-i program.
Protein sequences only.
