Description
-----------

Briefly, a PST (Probabilistic/Prediction Suffix Tree) is a data
structure that allows an efficient representation of a variable memory
Markov model (VMM, also known as VLMC, variable length Markov chain).

For a more detailed description, as well as literature pointers
please see the application note under the doc/ directory,
which accompanies the code.

That document describes the four provided executables:
train, predict, emit, 2pfa.
Compile them all using 'make'
For each, typing its name alone will give a short syntax summary.

Additional relevant publications are available at
http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~jill/publications.html
As an exposition it is recommended to start from either the short or long
Bejerano and Yona papers.

Notes
-----

Both training and test sequence files must be in FASTA format
(see http://tigrblast.tigr.org/web-hmm/fasta.html )
Of course the sequences themselves can be over any alphabet you define!

In "train", the second algorithmic variant is currently hard wired for 
proteins, as it contains amino acid prior values derived from BLOSUM.
However, these can be easily replaced with a different set of priors
over the desired alphabet.

In "2pfa", the stationary distribution of the resulting PFA is obtained
by LU decomposition of the PFA transition matrix.
See Chapter 2 of W.H. Press et al (1993) Numerical recipes in C: the art 
of scientific computing. 2nd edition, Cambridge.

Example
-------

In the example/ directory you will find the following files,
which relate to Figure 1 of the application note found in the doc/ directory:

inputs:
ab.bin    - the binary alphabet
bin.fas   - a simple string which we will use for training
new.fas   - a simpler string which will be used for prediction

(you can copy these to a new directory, say example2, and compare results)

training:
in the example/ directory, the following command line
../train ab.bin bin.fas @ @ bin.pst bin.stats:100 @ 1 .05 0 0 1.5 3
yields the following output files:
bin.pst   - the pst file that results from training a VMM from bin.fas
bin.stats - summary statistics of the PST

This PST is drawn in Fig. 1 of the application note.

prediction:
../predict bin.pst new.fas @ new.long @ @
yields the output file
new.long  - which holds P_M(1010), as in the caption of Figure 1.

conversion to PFA:
../2pfa bin.pst bin.pfa
bin.pfa   - The PFA equivalent of the PST bin.pst (see Figure 1, right)
            The probabilities to the right of the labels are the stationary
            distribution probabilities of the nodes.
