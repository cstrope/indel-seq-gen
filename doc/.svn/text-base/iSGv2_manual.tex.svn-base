\section{Introduction}

indel-Seq-Gen is a tool to simulate the evolutionary events of highly diverged DNA (coding and non-coding) and protein sequences.  Long-term evolution often include dynamic changes such as insertions and deletions (indels), but some subsequences, such as domains and
motifs, retain their original sequences and structures better than less functionally important regions.  indel-Seq-Gen allows for the simulation of many different evolutionary patterns over different regions of a sequence, in the end outputting the ``true'' multiple alignment of the sequences.  indel-Seq-Gen also has multiple unique features, including input a multiple alignment for the root sequence\footnote{This can be used to create different but related ancestral sequences in each run}, placing functional constraints on sequence sites, tracing mutations along the simulation and noting their positions in the true multiple alignment, changing evolution parameters and site conservation between subtrees (i.e., lineages), and more. In addition \iSGcurrentshort fixes a fundamental flaw in representing in representing insertions and deletions through the introduction of evolving along the guide tree in discrete steps. Finally, \iSGcurrentshort also introduces a novel method of representing conservation patterns with respect to insertions versus deletions versus substitutions. These features can be used in many evolutionary studies, such as to test the accuracy of multiple alignment methods, phylogenetic methods, evolutionary hypotheses, ancestral sequence reconstruction methods, and superfamily classification methods.

\section{Getting Started}

\iSGcurrentlong (\iSGcurrentshort) is freely downloadable at {\tt http://bioinfolab.unl.edu/$\sim$cstrope/iSG/}. \iSGcurrentshort has been tested MacOS X (versions 10.4.7 and Leopard).  You will need {\tt g++} compiler if the provided executables do not run on your system.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the {\tt \iSGcurrent.tar.gz} source archive, open the archive by typing the two commands:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item[] {\tt gunzip \iSGcurrent.tar.gz}, and then
 \item[] {\tt tar -xvf \iSGcurrent.tar}
 \end{itemize}
\item This creates a directory {\tt \iSGcurrent} with all of the files.  Go to this directory {\tt cd \iSGcurrent}. Make the executables of indel-seq-gen by typing the command ``{\tt ./configure}'', followed by the command ``{\tt make}''. For further installation instructions, refer to the file {\tt INSTALL}. 
\item After making the executables, type the command ``{\tt cp src/indel-seq-gen data/}''. This copies the executable into the {\tt data} directory.
\item Go to the {\tt data} directory using the command ``{\tt cd data/}''.
\item In the {\tt data} directory, there are sample files that can be used to run indel-seq-gen. The following commands will execute indel-seq-gen using various capabilities. Cut-and-paste (or type) these examples to run the simulations. After each run, you can examine the output of these runs by opening the filenames that begin with the name following the {\tt --outfile} or {\tt -e} flags:
\begin{verbatim}
./indel-seq-gen --matrix HKY --outfile DNA_out < simple_nuc.tree
./indel-seq-gen --matrix HKY --codon_rates 0.2,0.05,0.75 --outfile DNA_out < simple_nuc.tree
./indel-seq-gen -m HKY -e mid_noncoding --num_runs 5 < mid_nuc_noncoding.tree
./indel-seq-gen -m HKY -e mid_noncoding -n 5 -c 2,1,8 --invar 0.02 < mid_nuc_coding.tree
./indel-seq-gen -m HKY -c 2,1,8 -e exon_intron --step_type trs < exon_intron.tree
./indel-seq-gen -m HKY -c 2,1,8 --lineage exon_intron_lineage.spec < exon_intron_lineage.tree
./indel-seq-gen -m JTT -k lipocalin.spec -w a  --alpha 1.3 < lipocalin.tree
./indel-seq-gen -m JTT -k lipocalin_ma.spec < lipocalin_ma.tree
\end{verbatim}
 For further understanding of these examples, refer to Section~\ref{sec:example}.

\begin{GUI}
\item The {\tt \iSGcurrent/data} directory is the default working directory for the GUI interface for \iSGcurrentshort. Refer to Section~\ref{sec:GUI} for instructions on changing the default working directory. This working directory should contain the data files needed for the simulation. A script file, {\tt isgRemote}, is generated by the GUI interface to run iSGcurrentshort will also be created in this directory.
\end{GUI}

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

In order to simulate heterogeneous sequences and lineage- and site-specific \iSGcurrentshort uses \textit{enviroments}. The environment of simulation is comprised of
substitution parameters ($\Theta$; four components: $\theta^m \rightarrow$ substitution matrix , $\theta^f \rightarrow$ character frequencies, $\theta^r \rightarrow$ site rates, and $\theta^i\rightarrow$ percent invariable sites) and indel parameters ($\Lambda$; three components: $\lambda^p \rightarrow$ probability of an indel occurring as the number of indels per subsitution, $\lambda^l\rightarrow$ length distribution, and $\lambda^m\rightarrow$ maximum length). \iSGcurrentshort implements four environments: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Global environment}: Sets the default substitution parameters for the simulation run (indel parameters cannot be specified globally).
\item \textit{Partition environment}: Defines the partition-specific simulation parameters.
\item \textit{Subtree environment}: Defines the lineage-specific simulation parameters.
\item \textit{Motif environment}: Defines site-specific simulation parameters.
\end{enumerate}

Besides the motif environment, these environments define the same sets of parameters. For this reason, \iSGcurrentshort implements precedence for each variable, where the precedence, from lowest to highest, is global, partition, subtree. If any components of the substitution or indel parameter ar not changed in a higher precedence environment, that component inherits the settings from the next lower precedence environment. The motif environment does not conflict with the substitution and indel settings of the other environments, as it works specifically on sites. Precedence and settings can be found in Table~\ref{tab:precedence}, and an example simulation run using the precedence rules is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simulation_run}.

 \subsubsection{Discrete steps and Trace file}
 \label{sec:trace}
 
 \iSGcurrentshort has two discrete-stepping methods and one non-discrete stepping method. Discrete stepping methods are implemented because (i) There is currently no continuous model for indel evolution, and thus most current simulation methods simulate with a flawed indel representation, and (ii) discrete steps allow for concrete tracking of events during the simulation (refer to~\cite{Strope09}). However, such methods are slow, and impractical for very large simulation runs. Thus, \iSGcurrentshort also includes a new non-discrete stepping method that also fixes the flaw in indel representations. These methods are described below.
 
 \paragraph{Discrete Stepping Methods:} 
 \begin{itemize} 
 \item The Discrete Evolutionary Steps (DES) model simply calculates $\epsilon$, and simulates sequences along the guide tree in $\epsilon$ step sizes. 
 \item Event occurrence times can be related along the simulation guide tree with the \emph{time relative steps}, or TRS, representation. \iSGcurrentshort scales the branch lengths of the guide trees and branch-specific $\epsilon$'s so that all mutation events that occur in simulation run are ordered with respect to the relative time of the run (i.e., the simulation starts at relative time point 0.0, and all taxa end at time point 1.0). 
 \end{itemize}
 
 \paragraph{Non-Discrete Steps:} The DES and TRS methods of simulation are computationally intensive, and can take a very long time for large datasets. For this reason, {\tt indel-Seq-Gen} also allows the user to choose an indel creation procedure that utilizes the Gillespie algorithm (GIL), as described by Cartwright~\cite{Cartwright05}. Using the GIL of indel creation greatly speeds up the the simulation time, and the output of such runs is comparable to the TRS method (i.e., the indel events are still traced). {\bf WARNING: If you choose to change the amino acid/nucleotide frequencies along lineages, DO NOT use this option. Use either DES or TRS.} The DES and TRS options will immediately begin shifting the amino acid/nucleotide distributions, while the GIL option will shift the distributions gradually.
 
 \subsubsection*{Event Tracking}

 A benefit introduced by the above methods is the ability to track indel events by the following properties:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item ID
 \item Relative time of occurrence (from 0.0 (root of guide tree) to 1.0 (tips of guide tree); for the TRS model), 
 \item Set of taxa affected by change (i.e., subtree of occurrence), 
 \item Event type (insertion/deletion), 
 \item Indel length, and 
 \item Locations (columns) in the output MSA that reflect the event. 
 \end{enumerate}
 
 The time of occurrence for events is listed in different ways for each model: DES reports events by sequence partition (specified in the {\tt guide\_tree\_file} in the order they occur. TRS and GIL reports events by the relative time they occur in the guide tree. 
 
 
 %%%%%%%%%%% This is probably superfluous. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 %For example, see Figure~\ref{fig:input_MA}. Assuming a phylogeny that groups (Taxon1,Taxon2) and (Taxon3,Taxon4), positions 16--18 could have occurred in two ways, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:des}.
 %\begin{figure}

 Specifications for each partition are given in the {\tt guide\_tree\_file}. Specifications for each partition are separated by `;'. Refer to the Examples section (Section~\ref{sec:example}) for some sample tree files.\\

 \subsubsection{Specifying Subtrees in Newick Format}

 To specify subtrees for lineages and motifs, the Newick Tree Format must be clade-labelled, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:newick_clades}. For multi-partition simulation runs, note that internal node clade labels can be named arbitrarily, thus for a particular subtree, each partition can have a unique lineage-specific parameterization (e.g., Clade1\_1 for partition 1, Clade1\_2, for partition 2, \ldots). However, since taxon labels \emph{must} be consistant between partitions, unique subtree parameters cannot be made (e.g., specifying {\tt Taxon1} is ambiguous if more than one partition is used). To specify partition-specific taxon subsequence parameters, refer to Figure~\ref{fig:newick_clades} for the method of specifying subtrees for taxon subtrees.

 \subsection{Lineage and Motif Options}
 \label{sec:lineage}
 \label{sec:lineage_options}
 \label{sec:motif_options}
 Lineages and motifs are input to \iSGcurrentshort through the use of the global option ``{\tt -k}'' or ``{\tt --lineage}'' accompanied by the name of the lineage/motif file. This file consists of two parts: 
  \begin{enumerate} 
   \item LINEAGES, which change the conditions under which a subtree evolves, and 
   \item MOTIFS, which impose site-specific functional constraints on specific sequence positions for a specific subtree. 
  \end{enumerate}
 
The basic outline of this file is:
\begin{verbatim}
LINEAGES =
{
    subtree_list: "lineage_name"#subseq#{indel};
    .
    .
    .
}

MOTIFS =
{
    subtree:
        MARKER=<marker>;
        NAME=<motif_description>;
        PATTERN=<modified_PROSITE_motif>;
    .
    .
    .
}
\end{verbatim}

Lineages and motifs both work on subtrees (internal nodes named in input guide tree). To make a lineage or motif effective from the root of the guide tree, name {\tt subtree\_list} in LINEAGES or {\tt subtree} in MOTIFS as {\tt subtree:} to {\tt root:}, respectively. 


 \subsubsection{LINEAGES}
 Lineages allow for a specific subtree to evolve under different conditions as specified for partitions in the tree file.  Subsequence options (\#\#) are the only set of options affected by these restrictions, shown in Table~\ref{tab:lineage_options}. Labelling (``'') and indel (\{\}) options are no different than in partitions. {\it Note: In order to remove indels from a lineage, include the option \{0,0\} in the lineage.} 
 \iSGcurrentshort prohibits unrealistic changes, {\it e.g.} when changing site rates (gamma rates ($\gamma$), discrete gamma rates, codon rates, and uniform rates), \iSGcurrentshort only allows a subset of ancestor$\rightarrow$descendant category changes: $\gamma\rightarrow$\{$\gamma$, uniform\}, discrete $\gamma\rightarrow$\{discrete $\gamma$, uniform\}, codon$\rightarrow$\{codon, uniform\}, and uniform$\rightarrow$\{$\gamma$, discrete $\gamma$, uniform\}.

  \end{tablenotes}
  \label{tab:lineage_options}
 \end{threeparttable}
 
 \subsubsection{MOTIFS}

 Two steps are required to specify a motif: (1) Marking the root sequence in the \textit{rootseq} file (as in Table~\ref{tab:options}, formats 1--4), and (2) Specifying constraints in the lineage file. 

  \paragraph{Motif types:} \iSGcurrentshort allows two formats for motifs: PROSITE-like motif format and sequence template motif format. PROSITE-like motif format specifies any length of motif that follows the PROSITE regular expression pattern. Sequence template motif format is required to cover the entire sequence, and are used to place minimum and maximum length parameters on subsequences.
 
  \paragraph{Specifying sites on root sequence:} Marking sites is done in the root sequence input file, below the input root sequence or input multiple alignment. To begin marking the sequence, place a `*' corresponding to the first position in the root sequence. This \emph{must} be present for motifs to be correctly parsed. All other positions in the input root sequence must have a corresponding `*' or motif label (anything but `*'). Motif specification characters also must be contiguous, i.e., after specifying the positions that are in a motif, the rest of the motif specification line must be `*'s. As a regular expression, the PROSITE-like motif specification is: *$^+x^+$*$^*$, where $x$ is the character for the motif specification. For template-like motifs, the regular expression is *$[0-9]^n$\footnote{For multiple sequence alignment input, the regular expression is *$[[0-9],.]^n$, see Section~\ref{sec:ma_root} for details.}, where $n$ is the length of the root sequence input. There is no limit to the number of motifs that can be specified on a root sequence. Figure~\ref{fig:motif_errors} shows some errors that can be made in specifying motifs.
  
 \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{tabular}{lp{2.5in}p{2.5in}}
   \hline\hline
   Motif specification & Error & Fix\\
   \hline
   {\tt aaaaa***************} & Motif specification must begin with `*'\\\\
   {\tt *aaaaaa******aaaaa**} & Motif specification must be contiguous & split motif into 2 motifs, specifying each area, or make entire motif contiguous.\\\\
   {\tt *******aaaaaabbbbb**} & Can only use one motif marker per motif specification & split motif into 2 motifs, specifying each area, or make entire motif contiguous.\\\\
   \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\textit{Erroneous motif specifications for a root sequence of length 20, with the assumption that the motif is labelled by `a'.}}
  \label{fig:motif_errors}
 \end{figure}
 
  \paragraph{Specifying motif constraints:} After the motif-participating sites are labelled in the root sequence, specify the conditions that apply to each site in the lineage file. The fields for specifying motifs are shown in Table~\ref{tab:motif_spec}. 

  \begin{table}
   \caption{\textit{List of the options for specifying motifs. See Figure~\ref{fig:lipocalin_motif} for an example of a motif specification.}}
   \begin{tabular}{p{0.1in}p{1in}p{3in}p{1.5in}}
	\hline\hline
	\multicolumn{2}{l}{Field} & Description & Motif type \\
	\hline
    \multicolumn{2}{l}{MARKER} &  A single character, value can be anything except for the character `*' (see Section~\ref{sec:root} for specifying sites for motif).  This is the ID of the motif as specified in the root sequence input. & Prosite-like, template (0-9 only). \\\\
    \multicolumn{2}{l}{NAME} & Not required. This is the description of the motif. & Prosite-like, template\\\\
    \multicolumn{2}{l}{PATTERN} & Regular expression patterns, as below.\\
	 & {\tt [list]} & A list of acceptable amino acids or nucleotides for a site, site can take value of {\tt list}. & Prosite-like \\\\
	 & {\tt \{list\}} & A list of unacceptable amino acids or nucleotides for a site, site can take any value \emph{not} in {\tt list}. & Prosite-like \\\\
	 & {\tt char} & Invariable site, takes value of {\tt char}. & Prosite-like \\\\
	 & x & Site can take any amino acid or nucleotide value. & Prosite-like, template \\\\
	 & x($n$) & Next $n$ sites can take any amino acid or nucleotide value. & Prosite-like, template \\\\
	 & x($min,max$) & Variable length motif sequence. Cannot start a motif with a variable length motif position. This specifies that length of the motif positions can vary between $m$ to $n$ sites (variance caused by indels). Variable sites cannot overlap between different motifs. & Prosite-like, template \\
	\hline
   \end{tabular}
   \label{tab:motif_spec}
  \end{table}

 Note that when marking motifs, the marked positions must be the same size as the PATTERN specified. In the case of variable positions, \iSGcurrentshort requires that the maximum size of the motif (i.e., $n$ in {\tt x$(m,n)$}) are represented in the root sequence. To make this possible, you may need to place `-' in the root sequence or root MSA, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lipocalin_motif}. If a character is placed in the variable motif instead of `-', \iSGcurrentshort will assume that this position is part of the variable motif in the root sequence.

 \end{figure}

\section{Root Sequence Input}
\label{sec:root}

The root sequence is specified by the square brackets ({\tt [ ]}) in the guide tree file. There are three parameters, if used, for root sequence input:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Specifying the length of root sequence. indel-Seq-Gen will randomly generate a root 
sequence of the specified length.  For example {\tt [40]} calls for a root sequence of length 40 characterss.
\item Root sequence input.
\item Multiple alignment input.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these options is explained in the following subsection. Make sure that the input file is in the same directory when using a root sequence input file (options 2 and 3).

\subsection{Root Sequence Input}

This option specifies that the user has a root sequence in a file for a partition.  

In the tree file, the root sequence input is specified as:
\begin{verbatim}
[:<rootseq_file>]
\end{verbatim}

The format of the file \verb+<rootseq_file>+ is:
\begin{verbatim}
<length of sequence>
<invariable array>
<sequence>
<motif_spec>
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{fig:trx} gives an example of a root sequence for conserving a Thioredoxin-fold 
protein sequence motif.

The serine in position 9 will also be held invariable, though insertions are allowed to occur between itself and the previous cysteine.  Finally, the length of the root sequence is given by the first line. Note that this sequence is not truly a Trx-fold sequence, but an example to show the usage of the invariable array. (Right): Motif specification of the Thioredoxin active site. Motif specifications preserve both the length dependence and character subsets. Note also that the invariable array is no longer used to preserve the motif; it is recommended that when using motif specification, all non-motif positions in invariable array should be set to 0.}}
\label{fig:trx}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Multiple Alignment Input}
\label{sec:ma_root}
This option specifies that the user has a multiple alignment of their sequence set, and wants a root sequence created from the multiple alignment. In the guide tree file, the root sequence input is specified as:
\begin{verbatim}
[:<ma_file>(1,2,3)]
\end{verbatim}

Where options 1, 2, and 3 stand for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The range of the multiple alignment to use, where the format is {\it beginning}{\tt 
:}{\it end}.  An input of {\tt 21:67} specifies the range from the 21st to the 67th spot 
(inclusive) of the input multiple alignment.  Default for this option is the entire range of the multiple alignment. 
\item The number of sequences to choose from the multiple alignment.  indel-Seq-Gen randomly with replacement selects the specified number of sequences from the multiple alignment. Default for this option is to use all sequences.
\item Method for collapsing the multiple alignment into a root sequence, either random 
{\tt `r'} or consensus {\tt `c'}.  Consensus is a majority-rule method, using a coin flip to break ties.  Random uses a weighted coin toss based on the character composition at the site to choose the representative character, except for invariable positions, which will be chosen by consensus. For an example of the weighted coin toss, look at the first column in Figure~\ref{fig:input_MA} in which all sequences emit an amino acid, column 6.  In this 
column, there are 2 T's, 1 V, and 1 C.  A weighted coin toss on this column will be a T 50\% of the time, a V 25\% of the time, and a C 25\% of the time. The default for this option is consensus.
\end{enumerate}

When specifying the multiple alignment in the tree file, a blank field specifies that the default entry for the field is desired.  For example, \verb+[:input_MA(,,r)]+ indicates that the entire range and all sequences from {\tt input\_MA} will be used, but that the character that will represent the column will be chosen by a weighted coin toss based on the characters that appear in that column.  Note that the size of the root sequence can fluctuate between simulation runs.  For example, using the option \verb+[:input_MA(,1,)]+ will randomly choose a single sequence to create root sequence, thus the sequence that 
indel-Seq-Gen chooses will be the length of the root sequence for that subsequence.\\

Format:
\begin{verbatim}
<invariable array>
<sequence 1>
<sequence 2>
 .      .
 .      . 
 .      .
<sequence n>
<motifs>
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{fig:input_MA} is an example of an input multiple alignment of the SET-C region of the SET-domain family. The `-' is the only character that will be accepted for the gap character. Irregular characters (``YRUN'' in nucleotides, ``BZJX'' in amino acids) cause each character for which they stand for to be counted as the 1 over the number of characters they represent (e.g., `B' increments both `N' and `D' by 0.5). All `.'s in the template \emph{must} also be `.'s in all motifs coinciding with the same site. The reverse, however, is fine, as shown in this example, in the position just before the GxxL motif.

\label{fig:input_MA}
\end{figure}

 \subsubsection{Multiple alignment root sequence input for template motifs}
 
 Note that the multiple alignment root sequence input will have variable length, depending on the number of columns in the multiple alignment that are inferred to be gap columns ($>50\%$ `-' in a column). When specifying template motifs, all sites, except the first, must belong to a position in the template. For this reason, when specifying a template motif, \iSGcurrentshort also allows the character `.' on a position in the motif specification. The `.' character specifies that this site should be excluded from the template sites. For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:input_MA}, 6 positions of the multiple sequence alignment are excluded from the template specification.

\subsection{Invariable Array}

The invariable array in indel-Seq-Gen is a quaternary array that specifies how a region is 
allowed to evolve, and is specified in the root sequence input. Table~\ref{tab:invariable} 
shows the effect of each numerical entry in the invariable array, and Figure~\ref{fig:placement} shows an example of how the algorithm finds possible positions for indels based on the invariable array.

\section{Other Input Files}

\subsection{Character Frequencies {\tt \#f{\it freq\_file}\#}}

Protein and nucleotide subsequences often evolve under different functional constraints, causing them to display different character frequencies. For this, a file containing 20 amino acid frequencies (order: ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYV) or 4 nucleotide frequencies (order: ACGT) separated by commas can be entered for each subsequence with the option: 
\verb+#f<freq_file>#+.  Values from the input file are read and normalized to create a 
distribution, where the number of values is specified by the maximum indel size of the 
subsequence. For an example, see the file {\tt aaf.freq} included with all iSG {\tt .tar.gz} archive downloads.

\subsection{Indel Probabilities {\tt \{\#$_1$,\#$_2$,{\it indel\_file(s)}\}}}

Insertion and deletion frequencies can be provided for each subsequence.  The format of the file is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:zipf}.  This example is for the indel probabilities of sizes 1--10 of the Zipfian distribution described in Chang and Benner~\cite{Chang04}.  
indel-Seq-Gen will read in the number of values corresponding to the {\tt max\_indel\_size} (\#$_1$) specified for the subsequence (for Figure~\ref{fig:zipf}, the maximum indel size of a subsequence using this file can be up to size 10), and then normalize the values to create a distribution.  This means that the frequencies can be given in absolute numbers or in any scale (as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:zipf}).  If the maximum indel size is greater than the number of indel positions in the length distribution file, indel-Seq-Gen will output a message that it is unable to read the input distribution file.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

\section{Examples}
\label{sec:example}

 \subsection{Basic coding and non-coding}
 Despite the complexity that exists in iSGv2, the main goal of the simulation method is to be an all-purpose sequence simulator. Therefore, included in the distribution is a file called ``{\tt simple\_nuc.tree}'', shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simple_nuc}. 
 
 \begin{figure}
 \fbox{\tt [999]((Taxon1:0.3,Taxon2:0.14):0.5,(Taxon3:0.34, Taxon4:0.5):0.12);}
 \caption{\textit{A simple example of a nucleotide simulation partition file. This simulates a 999 nucleotide sequence with no indels, along a guide tree of 4 taxa.}}
 \label{fig:simple_nuc}
 \end{figure}
 	
 Given this example, assume the usage of the Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano~\cite{Hasegawa85} substitution matrix. The following two commands will create non-coding and coding simulation runs, respectively:
 \begin{verbatim}
 ./indel-seq-gen --matrix HKY --outfile DNA_out < simple_nuc.tree
 ./indel-seq-gen --matrix HKY --codon_rates 0.2,0.05,0.75 --outfile DNA_out < simple_nuc.tree
 \end{verbatim}

 This will also create five outfiles: DNA\_out.ma, DNA\_out.seq, DNA\_out.root, DNA\_out.trace, and DNA\_out.verb. In the first examples, the sites are mutated uniformly as is non-coding DNA. In the second example, the third coding mutates 75\% of the time, while the first and second codn mutate 20\% and 5\% of the time, respectively, mimicking codon position rates.

 \subsection{Including indels}

 A little more complex example including indels is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mid_nuc}. Notice that we now need to two trees to represent coding or non-coding sequences, since indel sizes that are not a multiple of three would cause a nonsense mutation.
 
 \begin{figure}
 \begin{tabular}{|l|}
 \hline
 \fbox{mid\_nuc\_coding.tree}\\
 {\tt [999]\{9,0.1/0.3,codonLD\}((Taxon1:0.3,Taxon2:0.14):0.5,(Taxon3:0.34, Taxon4:0.5):0.12);}\\

 \hline

 \hline

 {\tt 2628,743.8,355.5,210.5,140.2,100.6,76,59.6,48.1,39.7}\\
 \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{\textit{The specification files for a simulation run with indels, and the associated files, codonLD and idLD.}}
 \label{fig:ORF}
 \end{figure}

 The commands:
 \begin{verbatim}
 ./indel-seq-gen -m HKY -e mid_noncoding --num_runs 5 < mid_nuc_noncoding.tree
 ./indel-seq-gen -m HKY -e mid_noncoding -n 5 -c 2,1,8 --invar 0.02 < mid_nuc_coding.tree
 \end{verbatim}

 In this example, the previously introduced options {\tt --matrix}, {\tt --outfile}, and {\tt --codon\_rates} have been replaced by their short options. The {\tt --num\_runs (-n)} option has also been included, so that five runs will be simulated. The multiple alignments of this example is very gappy, since in the indel options, the maximum indel size is 9 nucleotides, and an insertion occurs once for every 10 substitutions, a deletion once every 3.3 substitutions. Finally, the option {\tt --invar} sets 2 percent of the sites to be invariable. Codon rate input also does not need to add up to 1, as \iSGcurrentshort will normalize the values.
 
 \subsection{Coding and non-coding together}
 \label{sec:coding_region}

 \iSGcurrentshort has the unique ability to simulate exons and introns in a single run. This adds yet more complexity, as you can see by the necessary files, as listed in Figure~\ref{fig:ORF}. Files that remain the same as previous examples are excluded from this figure.

 \caption{\textit{The specification files for a simulation run of one exon partition and one intron partition with indels, and the associated root sequence files, exon and intron.}}
 \label{fig:mid_nuc}
 \end{figure}

 The command:
 \begin{verbatim}
 ./indel-seq-gen -m HKY -c 2,1,8 -e exon_intron --step_type trs < exon_intron.tree
 \end{verbatim}

 There are many interesting things to note:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Codon rates are input at the command line. The subsequence option \#r\# in the intron sequence resets the rates to uniform rates in the intron. The additional subsequence options \#b1.2\# multiplies all branch lengths in the tree by a factor of 1.2.
  \item The file {\tt intron} conserves the nuclear-like spliceosomal sites (GU at beginning, G in the middle, and AG at the end).
  \item The option {\tt --step\_type} sets the simulation run to be in time relative steps. The output file {\tt exon\_intron.trace} will contain where each indel event occurred and the relative time of the event, as explained in Section~\ref{sec:trace}.
  \end{enumerate}

 \subsection{Lineage Introduction}
 Lineages are one of the unique abilities of iSGv2, paricularly the ability to cause a lineage to evolve under no specifications, which we call ``pseudogene'' evolution (the {\tt p} option in subsequence options {\tt \#\#}). To add lineages to the previous example, we need to specify clades in the partition file, create the lineage file and specify this file on the command line. Figure~\ref{fig:lineage_spec} shows the file changes, and Figure~\ref{fig:lineage_output} shows the output of the command:
 
 \begin{verbatim}
./indel-seq-gen -m HKY --lineage exon_intron_lineage.spec --alpha 1.3 < exon_intron_lineage.tree
 \end{verbatim}

 No output files are given, thus the output is printed to the screen. Note that the file {\tt outfile.verb} will still be created.

Subtrees on internal nodes can be uniquely named, thus the convention Clade\_$<$partition\_number$>$. Taxa cannot be uniquely specified between partitions, since they are required to be the same for all partitions. Thus, the taxon lineage (Taxon3) contains the list of partitions it is active in in parentheses. In this case, the lineage specifications for Taxon3 are active only for the first partition.}}
 \label{fig:lineage_spec}
\end{figure}

 Some finer points:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item The global parameter {\tt --alpha} specifies that, unless otherwise specified in clades, all branches in all trees will evolve with site rates, where the gamma parameter $\alpha=1.3$. However, Clade1\_1 and Clade1\_2 both become pseudogene lineages, which releases site rates from them. Taxon3 in the first tree also does not evolve with this gamma, since the lineage file specifies it to evolve with $\alpha=0.7$ ({\tt \#a 0.7\#}).
 \item Taxon3, partition 1, evolves without indels (\{0,0\}).
 \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Prosite-like motif}

To create Prosite-like motifs, a root sequence input is necessary. In this example, the lipocalin root sequence and motif specification in Figure~\ref{fig:lipocalin_motif} is used, along with {\tt lipocalin.tree}, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lipocalin_tree}.

\begin{verbatim}

To set up a run with a template, we will using the true multiple alignment sequences output in Figure~\ref{fig:lipocalin_output} as the input root sequence.

\end{figure}

To run this example, simply type:

\begin{verbatim}
./indel-seq-gen -m JTT -k lipocalin_ma.spec < lipocalin_ma.tree
\end{verbatim}

Note that this example incorporates both a motif and template, and that they do not need to coincide. This is often the case for real protein evolution, such as the lipocalins in this example, where the lipocalin signature begins in a coil region and ends in a beta strand. A good use of the template for this type of protein sequences is to make each $x(min,max)$ match with the coil regions and beta strands, as is done in the published work~\cite{Strope09}.
